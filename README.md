# 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction Classifier

Welcome to the **Rainfall Prediction** project! 🌦️ This project aims to predict whether it will rain the following day using various machine learning classification algorithms. The dataset is sourced from the **Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology**, providing historical weather data to train and evaluate our models.

## 🎯 Objectives

- 📊 **Preprocess and clean the rainfall dataset** to ensure high-quality input.
- 🤖 **Implement and compare multiple classification algorithms** for rainfall prediction.
- 📈 **Evaluate model performance** using various evaluation metrics.

## 🛠️ Algorithms Used

1. **Linear Regression** 📉
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** 🔍
3. **Decision Trees** 🌳
4. **Logistic Regression** 🧑‍💼
5. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** 🔲

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

- ✅ **Accuracy Score**: Measures how often the model is correct.
- ⚖️ **Jaccard Index**: Evaluates the similarity between predicted and actual labels.
- 📏 **F1-Score**: Combines precision and recall for classification accuracy.
- 📉 **Log Loss**: Measures the uncertainty of predictions.
- 🧮 **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Calculates the average of absolute errors.
- 🔢 **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Evaluates the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
- 📈 **R² Score**: Indicates how well the model explains the variance in the dataset.

## 📝 Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:

- `pandas` 📑
- `numpy` 🔢
- `scikit-learn` 🧑‍💻
